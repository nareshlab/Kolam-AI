**🏺 Ancient Foundations (3300 BCE - 300 BCE)**
The magnificent story of Kolam begins in the Indus Valley Civilization, where archaeologists discovered geometric floor patterns in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. These weren't mere decorations - they were the seeds of a practice that would flourish for millennia, connecting generations through sacred geometry and spiritual devotion.

**📜 Literary Documentation & Spiritual Evolution**

*Sangam Period (300 BCE - 300 CE):*
The word "Kolam" first appears in ancient Tamil literature, describing threshold decorations that welcomed guests and invited divine blessings. Poets wrote of women rising before dawn to create these patterns, establishing traditions that continue today.

*Buddhist & Hindu Integration (100-600 CE):*
As Buddhism and Hinduism evolved, Kolam absorbed mandala concepts and Vedic symbolism. The practice became a bridge between ancient Dravidian traditions and emerging spiritual philosophies, creating the rich cultural fusion we know today.

*Temple Architecture Influence (600-1200 CE):*
Kolam principles influenced South Indian temple design, with floor patterns becoming permanent architectural features. The mathematical precision of Kolam guided the sacred geometry of divine spaces.

**👑 Royal Patronage & Cultural Renaissance**

*Chola Dynasty (600-1200 CE):*
Royal courts elevated Kolam from household practice to fine art. Palace competitions featured master artists creating patterns covering entire courtyards. Mathematical treatises documented the geometric principles underlying traditional designs.

*Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646 CE):*
Cultural exchange with Islamic traders brought new geometric influences while preserving traditional symbolism. This period saw the development of complex Sikku patterns and sophisticated color theories.

*Nayak Period (1529-1736 CE):*
Regional variations flourished as each kingdom developed distinctive styles. Tamil Nadu's mathematical precision, Kerala's floral abundance, Karnataka's color innovations, and Andhra's unique motifs emerged during this cultural flowering.
